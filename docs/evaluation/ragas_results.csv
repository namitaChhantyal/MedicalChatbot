How does vaccination work against infectious diseases?,[]," Vaccination works by stimulating the immune system to recognize and fight specific pathogens. When a vaccine is administered, it introduces a harmless component of the pathogen, such as a weakened or inactivated form of the virus or bacteria, or a piece of its genetic material. This prompts the immune system to produce antibodies and memory cells that can quickly respond to future infections by the same pathogen, thereby providing immunity against the disease. Vaccination is a crucial public health tool in preventing the spread of infectious diseases.","Vaccines work by stimulating the immune system to recognize and fight specific pathogens without causing disease. They contain weakened, inactivated, or parts of the pathogen, or genetic material that instructs cells to produce harmless pathogen components.

The goal of chemotherapy is to eliminate or reduce the size of tumors, prevent cancer from spreading, and improve the patient's overall health. It can be administered in various ways, including intravenously, orally, or through injections.","Chemotherapy uses drugs to kill rapidly dividing cancer cells. Since cancer cells divide faster than normal cells, they are more susceptible. However, it can also damage healthy cells causing side effects. Different drugs target various cell division phases.
